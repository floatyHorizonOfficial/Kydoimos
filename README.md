# Kydoimos
A programming language which is tedious to use, not intended for practical things.

## How to Use
### Requirements
Hex Editor
Python 3
Lots of sanity (or not)

### Running Programs
After either getting or making a program file run
```python3 main.py [FILENAME]```
if no filename is given it will use "program".
